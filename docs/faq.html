  <h1>FAQ</h1>

  <h2>How do I report rule breaks</h2>
  <p>Stay in character, finish the scene, and submit a ticket with clear evidence. Use the <a href="/handbook/reporting.html">Reporting Guide</a>.</p>

  <h2>What is serious RP</h2>
  <p>Serious roleplay focuses on believable behavior, consistent character choices, realistic pacing, and respecting outcomes. Winning is not the goal. Story is the goal.</p>

  <h2>Can I join a gang</h2>
  <p>Yes. Recruitment and expectations are covered in the <a href="/sops/gang.html">Gang SOP</a>. Gangs require maturity, consistent presence, and clean conduct.</p>

  <h2>What if a system bugs mid-scene</h2>
  <p>Do not break character. Finish the scene in a reasonable way, then open a ticket with details and clips if possible.</p>

  <h2>Do you allow random killing or vehicle ramming</h2>
  <p>No. No random deathmatch and no vehicle deathmatch. Conflict must be built through roleplay and escalation standards.</p>
