  <h1>FAQ</h1>
  <h2>What if someone is breaking rules in my scene?</h2>
  <p>Finish the scene IC. Do not accuse mid-scene. Open a ticket after with evidence.</p>

  <h2>Can staff fix things mid-scene?</h2>
  <p>Staff avoids interrupting RP. They intervene immediately only for severe harassment, clear cheating harming multiple players right now, or server stability issues.</p>

  <h2>Do I need clips to report?</h2>
  <p>Clips are strongly recommended for consistent outcomes. Screenshots help but rarely show full context.</p>

  <h2>Where do I download SOPs?</h2>
  <p>Go to <a class="pill" href="/downloads/">Downloads</a> or each SOP page for PDF and DOCX.</p>
